# Distraction-Free YouTube – Browser Extension Using JavaScript DOM Manipulation

YouTube is a great learning platform, but recommendations, Shorts, and comments often cause distractions.  
This project solves that problem by providing a simple **Focus Mode** that hides unnecessary sections and helps users concentrate only on the video.

This extension is built using **pure JavaScript DOM manipulation** and works in real time on YouTube pages.
